Airbnb Clone Project
üìå Project Overview
The Airbnb Clone Project is a full-stack web application inspired by Airbnb. It aims to replicate core functionalities like property listings, bookings, and user management using modern web technologies.
Project Goal: Build a scalable, secure, and user-friendly platform to learn and apply real-world development practices.

üë• Team Roles
Role	Responsibilities
Backend Developer	Develop and maintain the RESTful APIs and business logic.
Frontend Developer	Create responsive user interfaces using modern frameworks.
Database Administrator (DBA)	Design, manage, and optimize the database schema and performance.
DevOps Engineer	Implement CI/CD pipelines, manage deployments, and monitor infrastructure.
QA Engineer	Write test cases, conduct testing, and ensure product quality.
Project Manager	Plan tasks, coordinate team activities, and track progress.

üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack
Technology	Purpose
Django	Backend web framework for rapid API and admin panel development.
PostgreSQL	Relational database for storing user, property, and booking data.
GraphQL	Query language for APIs to improve frontend efficiency.
React.js	Frontend library for building dynamic and responsive UI.
Docker	Containerization tool to standardize the development environment.
GitHub Actions	Automate tests and deployments with CI/CD workflows.

üß© Database Design
Key Entities:
User

id, username, email, password, role

Property

id, title, description, location, owner_id (FK)

Booking

id, user_id (FK), property_id (FK), start_date, end_date

Review

id, user_id (FK), property_id (FK), rating, comment

Payment

id, booking_id (FK), amount, status, timestamp

Relationships:
A User can own multiple Properties.

A Property can have many Bookings and Reviews.

A Booking is linked to one Property and one User.

A Payment is tied to a specific Booking.

üöÄ Feature Breakdown
User Management
Sign up, log in, manage profile, and role-based access (e.g., host vs guest).

Property Management
Hosts can list, update, and delete properties with images and availability.

Booking System
Guests can search, book, and cancel stays with calendar integration.

Reviews and Ratings
Users can leave feedback on properties they've booked.

Payments
Secure payment flow with transaction tracking and refund capability.

üîê API Security
Authentication
Ensures that only registered users can access certain features (e.g., JWT or OAuth).

Authorization
Role-based access control to restrict certain actions (e.g., only hosts can list properties).

Rate Limiting
Prevent abuse of public APIs, especially during booking operations.

Data Protection
Secure handling of personal and payment data using HTTPS and encryption.

‚öôÔ∏è CI/CD Pipeline
CI/CD ensures continuous integration and delivery of the project with high reliability.

Why it matters:
Automates testing and deployment to catch issues early and accelerate development.

Tools Used:

GitHub Actions for automation

Docker for containerization

Heroku/AWS for deployment (can be adjusted as per project plan)
