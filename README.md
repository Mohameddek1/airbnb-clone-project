# 🏠 Airbnb Clone – Backend Overview

## 🚀 Objective

Build a robust and scalable backend that powers an Airbnb-like platform, supporting users, hosts, listings, bookings, payments, and reviews with high efficiency and security.

---

## 🏆 Project Goals

* **User Management** – Secure registration, login, and profile management.
* **Property Management** – Creation, modification, and retrieval of listings.
* **Booking System** – Reservation handling, including check-in/check-out logic.
* **Payment Processing** – Integrated payment workflow for transactions.
* **Review System** – Users can rate and review stays.
* **Data Optimization** – Implement indexing and caching for performance.

## ✨ Feature Breakdown

### 1. User Management  
Allows users to register, log in, and manage their profiles securely. This is the core foundation for identity and access control across the platform.

### 2. Property Management  
Hosts can list properties with detailed descriptions, prices, availability dates, and images. It enables visibility of listings to potential guests and facilitates property discovery.

### 3. Booking System  
Users can book available properties for specific dates and manage upcoming and past bookings. This system ensures proper scheduling and avoids double-bookings.

### 4. Payment Processing  
Secure handling of payments linked to bookings using integrated payment gateways. It ensures a smooth and verifiable transaction process for both guests and hosts.

### 5. Review System  
After completing a stay, users can leave reviews and ratings on properties. This fosters transparency and trust within the platform by allowing feedback.

### 6. Admin Panel *(optional)*  
Admins can oversee user activity, manage listings, and monitor system health. It supports platform governance and moderation.

### 7. API Access & Documentation  
REST and GraphQL APIs are provided with comprehensive documentation for ease of use. This improves developer experience and promotes integration with front-end or mobile apps.

### 8. Performance Optimization  
Caching, database indexing, and async task handling ensure scalability. These improvements support a responsive user experience even with high traffic.

## 🗃️ Database Design

To support the core features of the Airbnb Clone, the database includes several key entities, their relationships, and performance-focused design decisions.

### 📦 Key Entities & Fields

#### **User**
* `id`: Unique identifier  
* `username`: Display name  
* `email`: Unique email address  
* `password`: Hashed password  
* `role`: Guest or Host  
* `created_at`: Registration date  

#### **Property**
* `id`: Unique identifier  
* `title`: Name of the property  
* `description`: Details about the property  
* `location`: Address or coordinates  
* `owner_id`: FK to User  
* `price_per_night`: Cost  
* `available_from`, `available_to`: Booking range  

#### **Booking**
* `id`: Unique identifier  
* `user_id`: FK to User  
* `property_id`: FK to Property  
* `start_date`, `end_date`: Booking duration  
* `status`: Pending, Confirmed, Cancelled  
* `created_at`: Timestamp  

#### **Payment**
* `id`: Unique identifier  
* `booking_id`: FK to Booking  
* `amount`: Total charge  
* `payment_method`: e.g., card, wallet  
* `status`: Paid, Failed, Refunded  
* `transaction_date`: Timestamp  

#### **Review**
* `id`: Unique identifier  
* `user_id`: FK to User  
* `property_id`: FK to Property  
* `rating`: Integer (1–5)  
* `comment`: Feedback text  
* `created_at`: Timestamp  

---

### 🔗 Entity Relationships

* A **User** can own multiple **Properties**
* A **User** can book multiple **Properties** (as a guest)
* A **Property** can have many **Bookings** and **Reviews**
* Each **Booking** is tied to one **User** and one **Property**
* Each **Payment** is linked to one **Booking**
* A **Review** is posted by a **User** for a **Property**

---

### 🧠 Design Considerations

* **Indexes** on `email`, `location`, and `property_id` to speed up search and queries.
* **Foreign keys** are used to ensure relational integrity.
* **Timestamps** are added to all models to track user activity and booking flow.
* **Normalization** is applied where appropriate to reduce redundancy.

## 🔐 API Security

Security is a fundamental aspect of the Airbnb Clone project. Below are the key mechanisms that will be implemented to protect the system and user data:

### 🔑 Authentication
- Uses JWT or OAuth2 protocols for secure login and session handling.
- Ensures that only verified users can access protected resources.

### 🛂 Authorization
- Role-based access control (RBAC) to distinguish between users, hosts, and admins.
- Restricts sensitive actions (e.g., editing properties) to authorized users only.

### 🚫 Rate Limiting
- Prevents abuse and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks by limiting API call frequency per user/IP.

### 🔒 Data Protection
- Sensitive data (passwords, payment info) is encrypted both in transit (HTTPS) and at rest.
- Validation and sanitization of all input data to prevent injection attacks (SQLi, XSS).

### 🎯 Why Security Matters
- **User Protection**: Secures personal and payment information from misuse.
- **Platform Trust**: Builds user trust and complies with data protection regulations.
- **System Integrity**: Prevents unauthorized access and data corruption.

## 🔄 CI/CD Pipeline

Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines automate the process of testing, building, and deploying code changes to ensure faster delivery and improved reliability.

### Why CI/CD Matters:
- **Speed**: Automates testing and deployment so teams ship updates faster.
- **Quality**: Ensures new code doesn’t break existing features through automated tests.
- **Consistency**: Guarantees deployments happen the same way every time across environments.

### Tools We Use:
- **GitHub Actions**: Automates unit tests, builds, and deployment pipelines.
- **Docker**: Ensures the app runs consistently across development, testing, and production environments.
- **Heroku / AWS / Railway (optional)**: For streamlined deployment of containerized applications.
